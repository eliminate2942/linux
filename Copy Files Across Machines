SCP (Secure Copy Protocol):

If you have SSH access to Client A, you can use the scp command to securely copy the file from a remote server or another machine to Client A.

From the source machine (where ca.crt is located), run:

bash
Copy code
scp /path/to/ca.crt user@client_a_ip:/path/on/client/a
Replace /path/to/ca.crt with the actual path to the CA certificate file, user with your username on Client A, client_a_ip with the IP address of Client A, and /path/on/client/a with the destination path on Client A.

You will be prompted for the password of the user account on Client A.
